# KQ_PLACEABLE_ITEMS INSTALLATION GUIDE

This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the KQ_PLACEABLE_ITEMS script for FiveM. 

## Step 1:

**<!> Only needed when using persistent items**

Next, you need to import the `kq_placeable_items.sql` file into your database. This will create the tables required for the script to function properly. You can watch this video for instructions on how to import an SQL file into your database: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBbqDLXrZGY.

## Step 4:
After the config file has been set up, add the script to your `server.cfg` file. Make sure that it's added **after** your framework of choice, so that it loads and starts properly.

## Step 5:
Configure the script to your likings. Add your own items and define the corresponding models.

## Done
Enjoy the script
